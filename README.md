> BetterLobby is a mod that improves the matchmaking system of _Content Warning_ by adding
> a __FILL LOBBY__ button in the pause menu

## Features

- Invite your friends in the lobby, and then fill it up with other people
- Fill the lobby back up when someone quits, even after the game has stated
- Avoid the standard matchmaking experience, which makes it hard to join a session
without an error

## Usage

- Install [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) in
the `Content Warning` game directory
- Copy the `BetterLobby.dll` file in the `BepInEx / plugins` folder
- Launch the game, click on __PLAY WITH FRIENDS__, and host a game
- Invite the friends you want to play with, then press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to open the pause menu
- Click on the new __FILL LOBBY__ button to open the matchmaking to the public
